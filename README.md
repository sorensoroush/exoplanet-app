# Exoplanet App

## What is it?

The Exoplanet Planetarium is a React app that fetches data from NASA's exoplanet archive and dynamically displays the data of various exoplanets. The data is displayed on HTML canvases, and it includes: planet orbit radius and eccentricity, planet mass and radius (relative to Jupiter), distance of the system to ours, and host star brightness, temperature, mass, and radius (relative to the Sun).

I had a general idea of how I wanted to lay out the information, but I changed the lower-right section to something that displayed information more meaningful than just the distance to our system. I ended up adding host star information as well because the archive contains a good amount of information about them.

### MVP EXAMPLE

- Find and use external api
- Render data on page
- Randomize planet and therefore randomize rendered data
- Navigate to different endpoints

### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add links on a page to go to a specific planet
- Ability to search for a specific planet
- Include orbits of planets other than Earth
- Include size of Earth as well as Jupiter (depending on exoplanet size)
